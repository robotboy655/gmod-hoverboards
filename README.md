# Hoverboards
The Hoverboards addon for Garry's Mod. This addon was not initially created by me, it was only fixed up and ported to GMod 13 by me.

The original authors as I could find are:
* Foszor
* Jinto.

# Installation
You do not need to download and install this addon manually, it is available on the Steam Workshop:

Simply press the green `+ Subscribe` button on the addon page and it will be automatically downloaded when you next start Garry's Mod.
